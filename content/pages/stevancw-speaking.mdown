#Speaking & Teaching

I last spoke at the [Ditial Doctor Conference](http://thedigitaldoc.co.uk) 2012 in Covent Garden.

It was great I'm sure I'll be speaking or teaching again in the physical world sometime soon but for now you can head over to the [Digital Doctor Podcast](http://thedigitaldoc.co.uk/podcast) and listen to my rants with [Ed Wallitt](https://twitter.com/PodmedicsEd) and [Wai Keong Wong](https://twitter.com/wai2k) about the state of IT within healthcare.
