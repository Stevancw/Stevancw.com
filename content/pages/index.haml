  #Welcome!

  My name is Stevan Wing and I am a neurology trainee in the East of England currently doing a PhD looking into Parkinson's disease and Parkinson's disease dementia.

  I love, love, love the internet and web development and I collaborate on various different web design and development projects. If you feel like getting in touch the best way is to drop me a line on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Stevancw).
