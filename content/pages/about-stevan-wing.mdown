#About me


I am a neurology registrar currently doing a PhD in [clinical neurosciences](http://www-neurosciences.medschl.cam.ac.uk) at the [University of Cambridge](http://www.cam.ac.uk) and Addenbrooke's hospital. 


I love food, cycling, [Appleâ„¢](http://www.apple.co.uk) and cold sunny days.

More to follow soon...
